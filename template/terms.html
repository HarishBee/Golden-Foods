If the Restaurant believes that any particular Customer's review violates any of the Golden foods' policies, the restaurant may write to us at neutrality@Golden foods.com and bring such violation to our attention. Golden foods may remove the review in its sole discretion if review is in violation of the Terms, or content guidelines and policies or otherwise harmful to the Services
